# Job Listing Application

The Job Listing Application is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, filter, and manage job listings dynamically. It combines a robust Django-based backend with a ReactJS frontend to deliver a seamless user experience. The backend interacts with an external API to fetch job data and provides RESTful API endpoints, while the frontend renders the data dynamically with features like pagination and search filters.

## Features

### Backend
- Fetches job data from an external API using a Python script (`utils.py`).
- Provides RESTful API endpoints for managing job listings.
- Supports operations like GET, PUT, and dynamic filtering.

### Frontend
- Built using ReactJS for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- Implements pagination for better data handling.
- Provides search and filter functionalities to refine job results.

## API Endpoints

The backend API endpoints can be tested using Postman or similar tools.

### Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/jobs/`

#### Example Endpoints:
- **GET**: Retrieve all job listings.
- **PUT**: Update a job listing.
